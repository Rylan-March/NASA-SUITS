- before interacting with the python scripts:
please run:

*** (python or python3 can be used interchangably)

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (or equivalent)
pip install -r piprequirements.txt

- then run python3 ________.py to activate any of the Python scripts (in most cases just use run.py)

*** remember to remove any venv directories or subdirectories

Docker Instructions:

\\\
Please remember to change the SENDER IP to the host TSS for example in my git diff
in this case my send ip was:

-SENDER_IP = '127.0.0.1'   # WebSocket source (your JS program)
+SENDER_IP = '192.168.0.55'   # WebSocket source (your JS program)
\\\


- run the node TSS first on the host

then run:
sudo docker build -t sysintns:v.4 .
sudo docker run  --name sysint -p 5555:5555 sysintns:v.4

while container is running to see logs:
sudo docker exec -it sysint /bin/sh
tail -f oxygen_log.txt

To stop the container:
sudo docker stop sysint

after container stops if you want to use existing container:
sudo docker start sysint

to wipe everything:

sudo docker system prune -a
